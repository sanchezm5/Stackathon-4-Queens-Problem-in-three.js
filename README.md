## Stackathon-4-Queens-Problem-in-three.js

the n Queens Problem:

How can you n queens be placed on an n x n chessboard so that no two queens 
are on the same row, column or diagonal? For this project, the 3D library, three.js 
is used to create an interactive approach to solving the problem for n = 4 queens on 
a 4 x 4 chessboard. The chessboard is a plane made up of line segments and each queen 
is represented by a cube. There may be more than one solution.


## Moving the Cubes

To move the cubes left, up, down, and right, respectively
For first cube: use keys 1, 2, 3, and 4
For second cube: use keys q, w, e, and r
For third cube: use keys a, s, d, and f
For fourth cube: use keys z, x, c, and v
